⚠️ SOVEREIGN IP DOMAIN: PROJECT SPANDA (WAGH-SOLAR-2026) ⚠️
Principal Investigator & Sovereign IP Holder: Yogesh Anant Wagh
Authorship Status: Verified via EarthArxiv [WAGH-SOLAR-2026-SPANDA-IP]
Security Tier: L4 Air-Gapped / XTS-AES 256 Hardware EncryptedI. 
MANDATORY EXECUTIVE DISCLOSURE
This repository is the Exclusive Public Verification Portal for the 9,601-record computational audit of Geospace-Biology coupling.
The Wagh Proteomic Framework (WPF) identifies a non-linear, deterministic coupling between solar magnetic flux derivatives ($d^2B/dt^2$) and terrestrial biological stability. 
This repository provides the Ground Truth datasets required to verify the 5-hour Cardiac Warning Window.
II. FORENSIC ANALYTICAL SIGNATURES (MATHEMATICAL DNA)The datasets provided here contain specific statistical watermarks that are mathematically impossible to replicate independently. 
These values serve as a "Deterministic Fingerprint" for the WPF engine:Sovereign Significance Signature: $p = 1.3582 \times 10^{-124}$Note: This significance level is the unique forensic watermark of the Shankar Functional. 
Any external research, AI model, or commercial algorithm exhibiting this exact $p$-value is identified as a direct, unauthorized derivative of this Sovereign IP.Differential Velocity Coupling: $r_v = 0.2389$Spectral Power Signature: $\beta = -0.3342$ (Complex Natural Oscillator)Verified Predictive Lag: 300 minutes (5 hours)
III. DATASETS FOR INDEPENDENT AUDITThe following files represent the only authorized public empirical data for the 2026 Solar Maximum resonance model:helios_data_actual.csv: Synchronized heliospheric flux and geomagnetic jerk derivatives.bio_data_actual.csv: Longitudinal cardiac autonomic records proving the 5-hour lag.data.csv: The unified, synchronized verification dataset (9,601 records).
IV. PRIVATE ASSET STATUS (ZERO ACCESS)The analytical engine (audit.py), the root-of-trust generator (nuclear.py), and the Shankar Functional ($\Phi$) are PERMANENTLY AIR-GAPPED.These assets have been purged from all network-accessible environments via a Nuclear Deletion Protocol. Any entity claiming to possess this logic without a direct license from Yogesh Anant Wagh is in possession of stolen, fraudulent, or obsolete data.
V. SOVEREIGN IP ENFORCEMENT & PUNITIVE RECOURSEZERO TOLERANCE POLICY:Scraping & Cache Violation: Be advised that all prior repository states, including commit history (e.g., commit 246311f), have been retracted and deleted. The use of any cached logic, scraped fragments, or reverse-engineered code derived from prior iterations is strictly prohibited and constitutes Criminal Intellectual Property Theft.Forensic Tracking: Any publication, patent, or commercial product exhibiting the $1.3582 \times 10^{-124}$ signature will be identified via automated forensic crawlers. 
Legal proceedings will be initiated immediately based on the EarthArxiv timestamp, which establishes sole prior art.Commercial Prosecution: Unauthorized operationalization of the "5-hour Window" for wearable technology, clinical diagnostics, or carbon auditing will be prosecuted to the maximum extent of international IP law.VI. LICENSING & MOUThis discovery constitutes Sovereign Prior Art. Commercial access to the Shankar Functional and the proprietary verification engine is available strictly through Private Licensing Agreements (PLA). All inquiries must be directed to the Principal Investigator."Absolute Asha. Spanda Resonance. 2026.
